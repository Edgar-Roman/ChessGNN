### Chess Game Analysis using Graph Neural Networks

**Application Domain**:
Chess, a two-player strategy board game that offers a myriad of complex strategies and tactics, presenting an intriguing domain for graph-based analysis.

**Dataset**: 
- **Name**: ChessDB - A database of 3.5 Million Chess Games.
- **Description**: This dataset encompasses 3.5 million chess games, capturing a vast array of strategies, player decisions, and game outcomes. It offers in-depth annotations and metadata for each game.
- **Task**: Given a specific board state, predict the likelihood of a win for white. This task allows us to comprehend key strategies and their effectiveness.
- **Metric**: We will employ accuracy for our primary metric, alongside the AUC-ROC to gauge the model's ability to distinguish between winning, drawing, and losing positions.

**Why this dataset?**
Chess games provide a rich tapestry of strategic depth and decision-making. The vastness of the ChessDB dataset ensures we capture a comprehensive set of patterns and strategies from varied game scenarios.

**Graph ML Techniques**:

1. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**:
    - **Description**: GNNs operate on graph data by iteratively updating node representations using information from their neighbors.
    - **Reasoning for this dataset**: Chess games can naturally be represented as a graph where each state of the game is a node. Transitions or moves between states act as edges. GNNs are apt at capturing such spatial relationships.

2. **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**:
    - **Description**: An extension of GNN, GAT introduces attention mechanisms allowing each node to focus on different neighboring nodes with varying intensity, depending on the context.

    - **Figure** (placeholder): [Attention Visualization]
    - **Reasoning for this dataset**: Given the intricacies of chess, not all moves or game states hold equal significance. GATs, with their attention mechanism, can capture these nuances by assigning varying attention weights to different moves or game states, discerning critical junctures in a game.

**Why GAT for this dataset?**
The inherent property of GAT to apply attention mechanisms allows the model to discern critical moves or states in a game. In the context of chess, where each move can drastically change the course of a game, GAT's ability to focus on pivotal moves makes it an ideal choice.
